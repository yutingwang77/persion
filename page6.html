                            </h3>
                            <p class="p2">After conducting in-depth interviews with over 70 individuals with diverse
                                gender
                                identities and expressions, I have carefully selected 10 representative cases to
                                showcase.
                                These cases encompass a wide range of gender identities and expressions, reflecting the
                                complexity and diversity of gender identity.</p>
                            <p class="p2">Please note that these 10 cases cannot fully capture the experiences of all 70
                                interviewees. However, they provide a window into the broad spectrum of gender
                                identities.
                                Each case is unique, reflecting personal life experiences, social environments, and
                                inner
                                worlds.</p>
                            <p class="p2">Through these cases, I hope to enhance understanding of gender diversity and
                                promote social inclusion and respect for different gender identities and expressions.

                                <h4>1. Fatty (username) (Occupation: Office Worker, 31 years old):</h4>
                                <p>Fatty is an individual who is biologically female but identifies psychologically as
                                    male. The
                                    formation of her gender identity was significantly influenced by her original
                                    family. <br>

                                    Family background: <br> Fatty's father played a relatively weak role in the family,
                                    was
                                    rarely at
                                    home, and didn't contribute much to the family. This weakening of the father's role
                                    may have
                                    influenced her perception of male roles, thereby affecting her gender identity. She
                                    also
                                    mentioned having an older sister, which may have had some impact on her gender
                                    cognition.
                                    <br>

                                    Childhood experiences: <br> During childhood, Fatty experienced bullying by boys,
                                    such as
                                    being
                                    pushed into a sandbox. These experiences had a subtle impact on her gender
                                    cognition,
                                    possibly making her develop a certain admiration or identification with male power.
                                    <br>

                                    Gender fluidity: <br>Fatty believes that gender is fluid. She states that she is
                                    "both a
                                    boy and
                                    a girl," reflecting her questioning of gender binarism and her complex understanding
                                    of her
                                    own gender identity. She possesses both traditionally masculine traits (such as
                                    bravery,
                                    physical strength, intelligence, ambition, capability) and feminine traits (such as
                                    tolerance, practicality, gentleness, virtue, and domestic skills).<br>

                                
                                </p>
                            </div>
                        </div>

                <div class="pg6Cttxt">
                    <p>
                        Social roles and views on marriage: <br> Despite psychologically identifying as
                        male,
                        Fatty is
                        open to marriage but uncertain whether she will enter into it. This reflects her
                        possible
                        contradictions and considerations between social roles and personal identity.<br>

                        Other influences: <br> Fatty mentioned not experiencing locker room humiliation, but
                        having a
                        certain fear of changing clothes in locker rooms due to media reports. This shows
                        the
                        potential influence of social environment and media on individual gender cognition
                        and
                        behavior.

                    <div class="info">
                      
                        <H4>2. 61A84F11 (username) (19 years old, college student):</H4>
                        <P>61A84F11 is a person who is biologically male but psychologically identifies as female. His
                            gender identity and expression have shown obvious tendencies since childhood. <br>

                            Early interests: <br>From a young age, he developed a strong interest in girls' clothes and
                            hairstyles, enjoying observing women's attire. This interest was not limited to observation
                            but included imagining himself wearing women's clothing. <br>

                            Key experience: <br> During a performance class in middle school, due to the scarcity of
                            male
                            students, he had the opportunity to wear girls' clothes. This experience allowed him to feel
                            the charm and power of femininity, possibly a crucial moment in recognizing and confirming
                            his gender identity. <br>

                            Behavioral manifestations: <br> He purchases women's clothing and cosmetics, and feels very
                            relaxed and comfortable when wearing these clothes, as if transported to another world where
                            he can forget worries and stress. This behavior is not just a hobby but a way for him to
                            express his true inner self. <br>

                            Gender identity and emotional tendencies: <br> He clearly states that he prefers women and
                            enjoys
                            being with them. In terms of gender cognition, he feels somewhat averse to males, even
                            finding them a bit disgusting. This strong emotional response may stem from his
                            non-identification with his biological sex. <br>

                            Understanding of gender fluidity: <br> He believes that gender is fluid, recognizing that he
                            is
                            male on the surface but female psychologically. This cognition reflects his breakthrough
                            from gender binarism and acceptance of his complex gender identity. <br>

                            Social and family influences: <br> He mentioned that his family might have some influence on
                            his
                            gender expression, but his family does not oppose his behavior. This relatively relaxed
                            family environment may have given him more space to explore and express his gender identity.

                        <P>Diavolo is an individual who is biologically male but psychologically identifies as female.
                            His gender expression is very obvious in daily life, not only does he feel more like a girl,
                            but his surrounding friends and family have the same perception. This gender expression has
                            brought him some social pressure, such as being insulted as a "sissy". However, he has also
                            received some support, especially from his close female friends. <br>

                            Diavolo shows obvious aversion towards males, which may stem from his non-identification
                            with his own biological sex, or because he has experienced discrimination from males. His
                            family has gone through a process of acceptance regarding his gender expression, from
                            initial disagreement to now being accustomed to it, although their attitude is still not
                            very friendly. <br>

                            In terms of emotional experiences, Diavolo currently has none, which may be related to his
                            gender identity and social pressure. Despite facing some challenges, he doesn't consider
                            himself an outlier, which shows his persistence in self-identity. However, he still feels
                            prejudice and non-recognition from some males, reflecting that societal attitudes towards
                            non-traditional gender expressions still have issues. <br>

                        <H4>4. Danggui (username):</H4>
                        <P>Danggui is a biological female but psychologically identifies as male. She comes from
                            Wenzhou, a traditional environment that favors boys over girls, which sparked her rebellious
                            spirit from a young age. She has a strong aversion to gender inequality phenomena, which may
                            be one of the factors prompting her to form a male identity. <br>

                            Danggui believes that in society, males have an easier time than females, and society is
                            more tolerant of males. This view may stem from her observations and experiences of social
                            gender roles. She often fantasizes about being male internally and is attracted to male
                            characteristics, reflecting her longing for a male identity. <br>

                            In terms of gender concepts, Danggui holds relatively open and fluid views. She believes
                            that gender should not be limited by traditional definitions, but should focus on the
                            essence of the soul and love. This view shows her deep thinking and unique understanding of
                            gender. <br>

                            Emotionally, Danggui expresses a preference for females. This emotional tendency forms an
                            interesting contrast with her male identity, reflecting the complexity of gender identity
                            and sexual orientation. <br>

                        <P>Love to Eat Big Rice Balls is a 27-year-old female working in media public relations. Her
                            gender cognition has gone through a process of change. During puberty, she experienced
                            gender ambiguity, but now has a clear and stable identification with her female identity.
                            <br>

                            The change in her gender cognition is closely related to childhood experiences. Due to her
                            body shape and appearance, she was mocked during childhood. To protect herself, she chose
                            gender-neutral dressing and behavior. This choice continued until high school, where she
                            completely avoided wearing skirts and even chose male-style uniforms. <br>

                            Now, she has accepted her female identity but still retains some gender-neutral traits. This
                            balance reflects her self-acceptance and open attitude towards diverse gender expressions.
                            <br>

                            In terms of sexual orientation, she identifies as bisexual. This further reflects her
                            diversity and openness in gender and sexual orientation.

                            expression was significantly influenced by her family environment. As the only girl in the
                            family, it seemed her family wanted her to be a boy more, instilling in her a heavier sense

                            Her growing environment encouraged her to play with boys from a young age, which cultivated
                            her boyish personality. Additionally, she mentioned being physically weak as a child and
                            used sports and street dance to improve her physical strength. These activities not only
                            improved her physical condition but also made her lean more towards boyish characteristics.
                            <br>

                            Www's experience reflects the important influence of family expectations and personal growth
                            environment on gender expression. Although her biological sex is female, her behavior and
                            personality traits are closer to traditional male characteristics.

                        <H4>7. "Hello" (username):</H4>
                        <P>"Hello" is a biological male but psychologically identifies as female. He likes to wear
                            feminine clothes, such as short skirts, and also enjoys dancing in a feminine style. These
                            behaviors and hobbies clearly express his female identity. <br>

                            He holds a positive and confident attitude towards his gender expression, believing it's a
                            personal preference that doesn't need others' approval. This attitude shows his firmness in
                            self-identity. <br>

                            "Hello" mentioned that his family might have some influence on his gender expression, but
                            his family doesn't oppose his behavior. This relatively tolerant family environment may have
                            provided support for him to explore and express his true self. <br>

                            For him, dancing is an important way of self-expression that brings confidence and
                            happiness. This reflects the important role of artistic expression in his gender identity
                            and self-realization. <br>

                            Overall, "Hello"'s case demonstrates a process of how to express and realize oneself through
                            external performance and art forms in a situation where biological sex and psychological
                            gender are inconsistent.

                        <H4>8. Interviewee (23 years old, International Chinese Teacher):</H4>
                        <P>This interviewee has strong individualistic tendencies and a unique gender identity. She
                            self-identifies as a "third gender", believing she is neither completely male nor completely
                            female. This understanding deeply influences her lifestyle and self-expression. <br>

                            In daily life, she tends towards gender-neutral dressing and lifestyle. She particularly
                            likes wearing suits and work pants, expressing her gender identity through this style. This
                            choice is not just about appearance, but also reflects her resistance to traditional gender
                            roles. <br>

                            This gender identity is also reflected in her social behavior. For example, when filling out
                            forms at school, she would add a "third gender" option to the gender choices. This behavior
                            shows her insistence on self-identity and her challenge to the existing gender
                            classification system. <br>

                            The interviewee has some understanding of the LGBTQ+ community, believing that Q represents
                            non-binary individuals. This indicates her open attitude towards gender diversity and that
                            she may have found some sense of belonging within the LGBTQ+ community. <br>

                            Her growth experiences, including experiencing campus bullying and family intervention, may
                            have influenced the formation of this unique gender identity. These experiences may have
                            prompted her to more firmly pursue her own identity rather than conforming to society's
                            conventional expectations.

                        <H4>9. Interviewee 2 (22 years old, Accounting and Finance position):</H4>
                        <P>This interviewee's gender identity has gone through a complex evolution process. Although her
                            biological sex is female, she has always been confused about her gender identity. <br>

                            Her gender identity confusion largely stems from childhood experiences. Being raised as a
                            boy by her parents from a young age deeply influenced her gender identity. As a child, she
                            even believed for a time that she was a boy. It wasn't until the third grade of primary
                            school that she gradually began to realize she was a girl, but this process was full of
                            confusion and maladjustment. <br>

                            After entering puberty, she developed a certain aversion to traditional female roles. She
                            mentioned feeling ashamed of things symbolizing femininity, such as the color pink, and was
                            unwilling to display too many feminine traits. This psychology might be a reaction to
                            childhood experiences, or it could be a resistance to society's stereotypes about women.
                            <br>

                            In terms of behavior and interests, she tends towards neutral or masculine expressions. For
                            example, she doesn't like playing very feminine roles, but is more willing to try neutral or
                            masculine roles. This tendency might be a way for her to find her self-identity. <br>

                            This gender identity confusion and tendency also affects her social interactions. She
                            mentioned preferring to interact with boys, feeling more relaxed and comfortable with them.
                            This could be an influence of her early upbringing as a boy, or it could be a form of
                            resistance to traditional female roles.

                        <H4>10. Jiang (username):</H4>
                        <P>Jiang is an individual who states that he has lived according to male thinking patterns from
                            childhood to adulthood. However, as time passed, he discovered that his psychology doesn't
                            fully conform to male characteristics. This change in cognition has sparked his thoughts and
                            confusion about his own gender identity. <br>

                            Conflict between personality and social expectations: <br>
                            Jiang found that his personality is significantly different from his male classmates. He
                            doesn't like intense sports competitions and isn't keen on competition. Instead, he prefers
                            to sit quietly in his seat and read books, a behavioral pattern that's closer to traditional
                            notions of feminine traits. <br>

                            Contradiction between aesthetics and social norms: <br>
                            Jiang expresses that he likes the color pink very much, which conflicts with society's
                            aesthetic expectations for males. These preferences have caused people around him to view
                            him strangely, leading Jiang to start doubting his gender identity. <br>
                            Family influence: <br>
                            Jiang mentions having an older brother, and there are obvious personality differences
                            between them. His brother exhibits traits that society generally considers masculine - a
                            fierce personality, decisive actions, and a love for sports. This contrast within the family
                            may have deepened Jiang's confusion about his own gender identity. <br>

                            Social pressure and prejudice: <br>
                            Jiang mentions that he has experienced prejudice, with people saying he's "effeminate" and
                            not like a man. These comments have caused discomfort in his heart, but he believes these
                            views stem from others' inherent notions and shouldn't determine a person's value. <br>

                            Personal views: <br>
                            Despite experiencing these confusions and social pressures, Jiang believes that everyone has
                            their own uniqueness. He doesn't consider himself an outlier, but rather believes that the
                            world's diversity comes precisely from everyone's differences. He thinks that if everyone
                            were the same, the world would lose its meaning. <br>

                            Views on gender identity: <br>
                            Jiang believes that gender identity shouldn't be confined to a fixed framework. He thinks
                            that everyone's true self-identity should be respected, and gender identity should be
                            diverse and inclusive. He compares traditional gender concepts to a kind of shackle,
                            believing it restricts some people from living according to their own ideas. <br>

                            Gender fluidity: <br>
                            When talking about his own gender identity, Jiang expresses difficulty in defining it. From
                            a physiological perspective, he is certainly male, but on a psychological level, he feels a
                            kind of fluidity. He has some hobbies and personality traits that don't conform to
                            traditional male characteristics, which has led him to question his gender identity. <br>

                            Attitude towards life: <br>
                            Despite facing these confusions and social pressures, Jiang chooses to live according to his
                            inner self. He believes that facing the world authentically and following one's heart is the
                            best way to live. <br>

                            Jiang's case demonstrates the complexity of gender identity, and how social norms, family
                            influences, and personal feelings intertwine to affect a person's understanding and
                            expression of their own gender. His experience reflects the challenges and considerations
                            that many people may face in the process of exploring and establishing self-identity.
